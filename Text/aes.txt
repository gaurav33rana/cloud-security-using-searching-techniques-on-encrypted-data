AES is a symmetric key encryption cipher. This means that the same key used to encrypt the data is used to decrypt it. This does create a problem: how do you send the key in a secure way?

Asymmetric encryption systems solve this problem by securing data using a public key which is made available to everyone. It can only be decrypted by an intended recipient who holds the correct private key.

This makes asymmetric encryption much better at securing data in transit as the sender does not need to know the recipientâ€™s private key. A good example is RSA encryption, which is used to secure the TLS key exchanges required when connecting to a secure HTTPS website.
